# Weakness types

We need to define weaknesses so that vulnerabilities, exposures and so on can be properly discussed and categorized.

## Existing Weakness databases

* CWE - https://cwe.mitre.org/
  * CWE submission - https://cwe.mitre.org/community/submissions/guidelines.html
* OWASP - https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/
* CSA Blockchain - https://csaurl.org/blockchain-vulnerabilities
